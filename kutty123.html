The Internet began in 1969 as a project of the U.S. Department of Defense called ARPANET, or
Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. The goal of this project was to design a
nationwide computer network that could withstand major disasters. If one part of the network
was destroyed, the other parts would continue to function due to the decentralized structure of
the network.
In the early days of ARPANET, there were four computers in the United States attached to the
network. Today, there are millions all over the world. Most people define the Internet as a
collection of computer networks, but what exactly is a network? A network is a group of two or
more computers connected together with cables that allow the computers to share information.
Computers that are “on the Internet” all use the same protocols to send information back and
forth, allowing them to communicate with each other. As long as a computer uses these
protocols, it doesn't matter what type of hardware or software it uses.
In the Internet's early days (the 1960s and 1970s), only government, military, and educational
institutions had computers connected to the Internet. The Internet was originally designed for
research and scholarly communication. But as it grew, its services became more popular, and
new ways of using the Internet multiplied. For example, the Internet began to be used for
informal communication, entertainment, and eventually commerce, as more businesses
connected to the Internet in the 1990s. According to statistics compiled by Nua Internet Surveys
Ltd., some 605.60 million people worldwide were connected to the Internet as of September
2002.
Today, the Internet remains decentralized, but it is no longer structured entirely around
government computers. It is comprised of independently owned and managed individual
networks of all sizes. The larger networks with high-speed connections are sometimes called
backbone providers.
